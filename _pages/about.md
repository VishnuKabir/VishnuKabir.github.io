I am a PhD Student at the Ohio State University, advised by Professor Kannan Athreya. 
My current research include but are not limited to: Artificial Intelligence of Things, Machine Learning for Wireless Networking, 
Federated Learning, AutoML. 

I am currently exploring a plethora of novel solutions to problems in the aforementioned domains, but more so in Artificial Intelligence of Things and Federated Learning.

Some fun hobbies of mine are: Ballroom Dancing(Waltz, Jive, Samba and such sorts), Social Dancing(Salsa, Bachata, Kizomba etc), Jamming my guitar and meditation(quite a few variety of these).
